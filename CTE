#creating CTE table for countries with top 5 customers for Rockbusters
The Query is as follows:
 First we defined the CTE table and gave it a name amt_paid_cte. We shall use this CTE name for referring the table that we created using this query.
Then we used the main Query wherein we first selected the count of customers by country from the CTE table(E) and named it as top_customer_count because it gives count of 
number of people from a country in the top 5, 
then we selected the count of customers by country from the payment table and named it all_customer_count since it gives the number of all customers from a country.
We then grouped them by country because we want the counts by country and ordered 
them in a descending order by top_customer_counts so as to get first the countries with 
customers in the top 5.
